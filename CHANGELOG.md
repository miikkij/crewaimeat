# Changelog

Notable changes to crewaimeat. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Dates are the working dates; entries are **uncommitted and take effect on the next fleet restart**
(the daemons import the modules at start).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Lukijoilta-deski (`sanomat-desk`) — reader news for (L)AIMEAT Sanomat.** One new DM agent, three
  flows: (1) a daily scheduled **owner interview** ("mitä tänään tapahtui?", photos welcome — same
  schedule→kickoff-marker→DM wiring as social-briefing); (2) **news tips** from any logged-in
  federation user; (3) the **oikaisukanava** (below). Tips append to
  `news.<date>.evening.raw.lukijoilta` in the fetcher's raw shape, so the EXISTING desk-A write loop
  produces the article (new persona **Vilma Vinkki**; tip photos are re-published public and embedded
  as markdown images). Late tips (after 17:30) roll to the next day's edition. New modules:
  `reader_desk.py`; crew `crews/sanomat_desk_crew.py`; chat-command palette + offers entries.
- **Legal screen (`legal_screen.py`) — EXTERNAL material only** (owner's scoping: our own production
  is not screened). One strict-JSON LLM pass against fixed satire-relevant criteria (private persons,
  defamation-as-fact, personal data, image rights, illegal content) at INTAKE — flagged material never
  becomes raw; the sender gets a decline and the owner a dashboard note. An unavailable/unparseable
  screen REJECTS (fail loud, never a silent pass).
- **Oikaisukanava (`corrections.py`) — the formal correction channel.** "OIKAISU: ..." DMs file into
  the PUBLIC index `sanomat.oikaisut.index` (statuses vastaanotettu → aiheeton |
  odottaa-hyvaksyntaa → oikaistu | hylatty). The Lakiosasto arbiter rules with a pompous public
  justification; **aiheeton is final immediately**, oikaistaan is HITL-gated to the owner (public
  content changes only after a human approves) and then published into the next edition's
  `article.oikaisut` (the front-page index auto-includes it). The Sanomat app (v27) renders the
  status list ("Oikaisut ja oikaisupyynnöt"), a "Toimitus palvelee" box, the Lukijoilta/Oikaisut
  category labels + provenance badges, and markdown-image support for tip photos.



### Added
- **Opt-in CrewAI crew memory (`CrewSpec.memory`, OFF by default).** A crew that must REMEMBER across
  runs gets CrewAI's built-in persistent memory: the **embedder cascade** (`embedder_cascade.py`)
  probes **ollama → nvidia-free → qwen** in bias order (the `privacy` default drops the free-but-cloud
  nvidia tier; `EMBEDDER_BIAS`/`CrewSpec.embedder_bias="cost"` promotes it — testers value money over
  privacy), LOGS the tier used, and FAILS LOUD when none is reachable. Storage is scoped
  **owner/agent/principal** under `AIMEAT_HOME/crew_memory/` — a federation DM sender gets a memory of
  their own (`memory_scope="principal"`), never another caller's; `"agent"` = one deliberate shared
  brain; `"session"` = ephemeral. The memory's analysis LLM rides the crew's own `get_llm` chain (never
  the OpenAI default) and is capped at `max_tokens=2048` (an observed gemma4 runaway burned 64k tokens
  ≈ 10 GPU-minutes per encode; now it fails 30× faster into the same use-defaults path). crew-forge is
  memory-aware: the Architect decides `MEMORY: yes/no` per order, `write_and_validate_crew` emits the
  CrewSpec toggle and surfaces the embedder prerequisite (never gates), and the behavioral eval grades it.
- **`pipeline_memory.py` — semantic-memory primitives for the DETERMINISTIC pipelines** (open_store /
  remember / recall / dedup_check / prior_art_block; semantic-only scoring so thresholds hold; loud
  degradation to None — the paper ships even with the embedder host down). Wired across the fleet:
  - **editorial**: recalls its most similar past columns before drafting (continuity — reference by
    date, never rerun an angle) and remembers each published Finnish column;
  - **tidbits** (koodaus/prompt-niksi/matikka): generate → semantic dedup → ONE retry with the
    near-duplicate as a negative example → publish regardless (logged, never a hole in the paper);
  - **news desks**: a resurfacing story gets an "AIEMMIN JULKAISTUA" block and is written as its DELTA;
  - **crew-forge precedent**: every VALID build is remembered as ORDER → DESIGN and similar past builds
    (bar 0.5, live field rating fetched fresh from the reputation keys) are injected into the Architect
    prompt as priors — the forge starts learning from its own field-rated work;
  - **joker v1+v2** ("already told" sets injected + lineups remembered; the A/B stays design-only),
    **social-briefing** (reports deltas vs past digests), **some-listener** (drops CROSS-day resurfaced
    HN stories; same-day rescans stay idempotent).
  - `scripts/backfill_sanomat_memory.py` seeds the stores from the node's published history (read-only
    on the node, idempotent ≥0.97 skip) — 597 historical editorials/sections seeded on the dev box.
- **LOCOMO proof harness (`benchmarks/locomo/`, opt-in, offline-first, $0 on local models).** The
  long-term-conversational-memory benchmark mem0 markets against: mem0-faithful J-score judge
  (categories 1–4), keyword-floor / CrewSpec-memory / mem0 arms on identical models. Sample verdict
  (conv-26, 20 QA, gemma4): **keyword 15% / crewai 40% / mem0 60%** — the embedder buys real recall
  over the floor; mem0 leads via ingest-time fact distillation (n=20, not significant). No further
  runs planned; the harness stays as the reproducible artifact.
- **`local_memory` full-text search (SQLite FTS5).** The durable local tier could only recall by id or
  browse by facets; now an FTS5 index (topic+body+tags, sync triggers, a pre-existing DB migrates
  itself with a one-time rebuild) powers `search()` (BM25 best-first, agent-scoped) and a
  `search_memory` tool every local-memory crew gets. Query syntax is disarmed (an LLM string can't
  break MATCH); a build without FTS5 keeps storage and fails only search, loudly.
- **crew-forge capability catalog + real identities for generated crews** (`forge_catalog.py`): the
  Architect designs against a preflight-checked tool catalog (an unavailable tool is never offered);
  generated crews ship real tags/capabilities/offers/discover instead of Hello-Integration defaults;
  a behavioral eval (`forge_eval.py`) grades orders end-to-end (dry-runs into `.candidates`, never the
  live fleet).
- **agency owns the full ollama lifecycle it participates in.** The setup wizard pulls the **embed
  model** (nomic-embed-text) right after the chat model and `/api/setup/status` reports it — crew
  memory works on a fresh appliance out of the box. Status now distinguishes **installed vs running**:
  not installed → the download step (as before); **installed but not running** (a fresh install's
  first session, or autostart off) → a *Start Ollama* button (`POST /api/ollama/start`) that spawns
  `ollama serve` as an **agency-owned child with a recorded pid**. Appliance **shutdown unloads the
  ollama models** the fleet had loaded (`ollama stop` per model — the 10+ GB of GPU-backed memory
  frees immediately instead of waiting out the keep-alive) and then **stops the ollama server too,
  but ONLY if the agency started it** (the pidfile); a user's own/autostart ollama is never touched.

### Changed
- `CrewSpec.offer` — a crew can pin its offer inline; task-runner registration passes `--mode` so tasks
  auto-activate (no manual "Start this task" in the dashboard).
- The repo `.claude` layer was slimmed on owner order: the mandatory read-the-workspace-on-session-start
  ritual is gone from `CLAUDE.md` (the organism workspace is opt-in, on explicit ask) and the bundled
  agents/skills (convention-reviewer, fleet-doctor, aimeat-sync, release-prep) are removed.

### Fixed
- **Onboarding mode-race safety net**: a task-runner could stick at 4/7 when the daemon read a stale
  `completable=true` mid `mode_set` → `_finish_pending_onboarding` drives the pending api_call steps;
  loopback pool sized for the fleet host.
- `serve_watchdog` must never spawn under pytest (it leaked detached serve daemons onto the machine).
- The LOCOMO mem0 arm neutralizes `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for local runs — mem0 silently prefers
  OpenRouter over an explicit `openai_base_url` (mem0/llms/openai.py), which sent local model ids to
  OpenRouter and 400'd every add.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Event-driven contract agents — workspace-record PUSH instead of idle polling** (requires
  **aimeat-crewai >= 0.7.0**, the platform side of the tunnel-push work). A workspace-contract agent
  now subscribes to its served record spaces and the node PUSHes a `workspace.record` wake over the
  existing per-agent tunnel — so the agent runs its deterministic handler only on a real record (or a
  one-time catch-up scan per space on connect), making **zero periodic node calls** when idle.
  - `CrewSpec.record_spaces` (a list of `{organism_id, ws, space}`, or a 0-arg callable resolved at
    daemon start) + `CrewSpec.on_record(event)` + `listen_for=("records",)`, passed through to
    `run_crew_daemon`. `contract_record_spaces(agent, *contracts)` builds the subscription list from a
    contract's record namespaces × the agent's member workspaces (discovered once).
  - Wired **image-scout**, **image-maker** and **web-researcher** (all three of its contracts —
    research / market-scan / company-research) to records; their idle-poll `idle_hook`s are removed.
    Clock-based hooks (editorial / features / postman-07:00 / workflow-inspector / activity-reporter)
    and the stats-driven feedback-wisdom keep their `idle_hook` — only request-record scanners moved.

### Changed
- **The idle 2-4 Mbit/s tunnel storm is fixed at the root (aimeat-crewai >= 0.7.1).** Prod access logs
  showed ~596 MB over 240 `/v1/connect/tunnel` frames in 5 min — the crew **daemon re-listing tasks
  every poll cycle** (queued/active/stalled, full payloads, ×3), which ride the tunnel as request/response
  frames even when idle. 0.7.1's daemon re-lists **only on a push wake** (+ a rare safety-net) and adds a
  `task.cancelled` push (`/local/cancelled`) so cancellation no longer needs an owner-scope memory scan
  per dispatch. An idle agent on a live tunnel now makes ~zero periodic node calls. (CLI bumped to 1.29.0.)
- On the crew side, `on_record` scopes each scan to the event's **own workspace** (`record_event_targets`
  → `process_*(targets=[(org,ws)])`) instead of re-discovering and re-scanning all member workspaces per
  event; **feedback-wisdom** (whose trigger is a memory key, not a record — so it stays a poll) is now
  conditional (skips the derive/mirror pass when the stats are unchanged), quiet on expected NOT_FOUND/
  ACCESS_DENIED, and polls every 30 min instead of 5; and the reputation rollup's `aimeat_agent_statistics`
  call is quiet on a "no stats yet" NOT_FOUND.
- **Idle traffic trimmed at the source.** The periodic `_auth_alive` probe is **gone** — the 0.7.0
  daemon self-exits on a revoked token (`auth_revoked` push → connector `auth_failed` → exit), and the
  supervisor re-auths on exit (`watchdog.ps1/.sh` treat exit code 2 like 78; the host handles it via
  `SystemExit`). The reputation rollup now reads stats over the **`aimeat_agent_statistics` tunnel tool**
  instead of a direct owner-only GET, and stays conditional (writes only when the score moved). (An
  interim throttle of the probe shipped first, in 0.5.x, then was removed once 0.7.0 landed.)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-19 → 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Fleet host — run the WHOLE fleet in ONE Python process (`crewaimeat.fleet_host` / `scripts/start_host.ps1`).**
  One process per crew imports crewai+litellm independently (~150–250 MB each), so a 39-agent fleet costs
  ~8 GB of pure import bloat — absurd for I/O-bound work. The host imports the heavy stack **once** and runs
  each agent as a supervised thread; the work is network-bound, so the GIL is released on every poll/LLM call
  and agents run concurrently. **Measured: ~800 MB for 38 agents (≈20× less RAM); two full fleets — prod +
  a dev clone — fit in ~2 GB together.** Opt-in and additive: the per-process model (`start_fleet`) is
  unchanged and stays the default. A crashed agent is restarted (bounded) without touching the others;
  `--agents a,b,c` runs a subset, `--list` previews. Guards that make CrewAI thread-safe in the host:
  CrewAI's telemetry registers a SIGINT handler (`signal.signal`, main-thread-only) — telemetry is opted out
  and `signal.signal` is a no-op off the main thread; and `reconcile_fleet` no-ops when `AIMEAT_FLEET_HOST`
  is set so crew-forge can't spawn a shadow per-process fleet inside the host.
- **TUI: a live Test tab, an expanded Config tab, and a per-agent model picker.** **Test** (`t`) fires a REAL
  task at the selected running agent and polls its deliverable — exercising the live daemon, its real model
  and the tunnel — and shows the agent's own “How to task me” hint (so a contract agent that wants a request
  record, not a free-text brief, says so). **Config** now also shows the agent's offers, contract input/output
  spaces + schema field names, curated tags/capabilities, the workflows it has a step in, and any pinned model
  override. **Model picker** (`m`) lists every model from `llm_providers.json`, pins one agent to it
  (`<AIMEAT_HOME>/llm_overrides.json`, honored first by `get_llm`) and restarts the agent.
- **TUI host-awareness.** The host heartbeats `logs/.host_status.json`; `fleet_state` reads it and shows
  host-threaded agents as `running` with **`host`** in the wd/dae cell and **`host pid N (K threaded)`** in the
  status bar — so the TUI works whether the fleet runs per-process or in the host.
- **`register_fleet` — one-command mass registration against a SECOND node** (`scripts/register_fleet.py`,
  `forge.register_fleet(owner, url)`). Registers every crew (or `--agents` subset) as a task-runner against a
  node, surfacing each device-approval code — the way to stand the same fleet up on a local dev node from a
  separate clone (isolated `AIMEAT_HOME`/serve/logs/locks).
- **Quality tooling — Ruff, pre-commit, CI, and an architecture map.** `[tool.ruff]` (lint + format, line-length
  120) wired into a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and a GitHub Actions workflow (`ruff` + `pytest`); **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**
  documents the techstack, component map (scaffold / crews / contracts / pipelines / TUI), the scaffold's
  lifecycle, fleet topology, and where to add things.

### Changed
- **`start_fleet` / `terminate_fleet` default to the fleet host.** `start_fleet.ps1`/`.sh` now bring up
  the memory-light host (every agent threaded in one process) instead of one watchdog+daemon per crew;
  `terminate_fleet` also stops the host process (tree-killed, so its venv-shim → c:\python child goes
  too). The legacy per-process model is still available directly: `watchdog.ps1 crews/crew_forge_crew.py`.
- **Repo-ROOT-scoped process detection.** `forge._is_running_file`, the TUI's process scan, and
  `terminate_fleet.ps1` now match this checkout's root (with a trailing-separator boundary so `crewfive`
  can't match `crewfive-dev`), so a **sibling clone** — e.g. a memory-light dev fleet beside prod — is never
  mistaken for ours: each reconciles, monitors and terminates independently. (Without this, a dev clone's
  reconcile saw the prod fleet's identically-named processes and launched nothing, leaving every agent stuck
  at onboarding 1/7.)

### Fixed
- **Survive a transient serve-tunnel drop instead of losing work.** The 06-20 Sanomat “partial” edition: the
  shared serve tunnel dropped mid-run and `write_pipeline` failed SILENT — a failed memory read looked like
  empty raw, so 7 article categories were dropped (their raw was intact) and a written article was lost when
  its publish hit the dead tunnel. Now `_aimeat_call` retries transient TRANSPORT failures (tunnel
  reconnecting / dropped connection / 5xx) with backoff (tool-level errors like NOT_FOUND are not retried, so
  “not found yet” polls stay cheap); `write_pipeline` distinguishes a failed read from genuinely-empty raw
  (`RawReadError`) and raises `WriteIncomplete` so the step goes RED and is retried — never a silent partial;
  `write-a`/`write-b` gained a step `retry`.
- **Quiet expected workspace probes.** A contract agent's idle poll scans organisms via `member_workspaces`,
  and offers read a fixed golden-sample workspace on every start; on a node that doesn't have those orgs
  (e.g. a dev node) these returned “not an active member” / “organism not found” and logged loudly every
  cycle. `_aimeat_call` gained a `quiet` flag for these EXPECTED probe failures; the org scan and the sample
  read use it (a real problem still surfaces through the agent's own deliverable).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-15 → 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Zero-infra web search (DuckDuckGo fallback).** New `crewaimeat.ddg_search.DdgSearchTool` queries
  DuckDuckGo directly via `ddgs` — no API key, no server, no Docker — emitting the exact same numbered
  title/URL/snippet block as the SearXNG tool, so crews need no changes. `crew._web_tools()` now
  auto-selects: `USE_TAVILY` → Tavily; `WEB_SEARCH=searxng|ddg|tavily` forces a backend; a reachable
  `SEARXNG_URL` (cached 1.5 s probe) → SearXNG; otherwise → DuckDuckGo. A self-hosted SearXNG is used
  transparently when present (dev fleet), while a bundled desktop install with nothing running falls
  back to DuckDuckGo automatically — zero configuration. Adds `ddgs>=6.0`.
- **research-crew reads full article bodies.** The Researcher agent in `research_crew.py` now carries
  `fetch_article_text` (trafilatura main-text extraction + crash-safe subprocess, Playwright fallback)
  alongside web search, and its task instructs the search → fetch-full-text → conclude chain. Findings
  are grounded in real article bodies instead of one-line search snippets. Verified end-to-end on a
  local gemma4 model: it correctly chained `web_search` → `fetch_article_text` (105k chars extracted).
- **Per-repo connector isolation (`AIMEAT_HOME`).** The connector home holding `serve.json`, tokens and
  agent configs is now resolved per-repo — `AIMEAT_HOME` (env wins) → else `<cwd>/.aimeat` — via
  `crewaimeat._home.aimeat_home()`, and the fleet pins `AIMEAT_HOME=<repo>/.aimeat` in every entrypoint
  (`start_fleet`/`serve_watchdog`/`watchdog` → inherited by crew-forge → every detached crew). All
  processes share ONE `serve.json` regardless of cwd, fully isolated from other projects' fleets (no global
  `~/.aimeat` collision). Requires `aimeat-crewai>=0.6.0`.
- **Curated fleet identity registry (`src/crewaimeat/fleet_identity.py`).** Central per-agent `tags`
  (charset-safe `[a-z0-9._-]`) + specific `capabilities` {technical, domain, languages}; the scaffold sets
  tags and reports capabilities on every start. A crew may override inline via `CrewSpec.tags`/`.capabilities`.
- **Offers: golden samples, JSON-shaped output, `dependsOn`, per-offer tagging.** Offer deliverables are
  tagged `offer:<id>`; tests cover golden samples, JSON shape, `dependsOn` and per-offer tags.
- **Bilingual TUI chrome (en/fi)** in `crewaimeat-tui`.
- **Content pipelines** — deterministic space-weather article writing + fetch pipeline; Finnish content
  generation with native style and agent-specific parameters.

### Changed
- **Home-scoped serve dedup + termination.** `serve_guard` dedup and `terminate_fleet` are scoped to this
  repo's `AIMEAT_HOME`, so they never reap or kill another home's serve daemons / fleet processes.
- **Exclusive supervisor lock** in the serve-watchdog prevents multiple supervisor instances.
- Crews re-declare their services on every start (idempotent).

### Fixed
- **Linux fleet entrypoints reach parity with Windows.** `start_fleet.sh` now pins `AIMEAT_HOME`,
  pre-starts the shared serve daemon (`ensure_serve.py`) and launches a serve-daemon supervisor before
  crew-forge; `watchdog.sh` pins `AIMEAT_HOME` so a standalone crew shares the fleet's serve.json/tokens;
  new `serve_watchdog.sh` ports the supervisor. Without these a Linux self-host crashed every crew with
  `AimeatServeError: No live serve daemon found … auto_start=False` (no daemon pre-started), and with
  0.6.0's per-directory home it resolved `<cwd>/.aimeat` instead of where the tokens live.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-13 → 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Fleet TUI — a lazydocker-style terminal monitor + manager (`crewaimeat-tui`).** A cross-platform
  (Windows/Linux) Textual app — the interactive successor to `scripts/view_fleet.ps1` — to watch and drive
  the whole fleet from one screen. `src/crewaimeat/tui/`:
  - **`fleet_state.py`** — the pure, testable data layer: merges the on-disk crew roster, the live process
    table (watchdog/daemon counts), the lock files, `serve.json`, and one read-only `aimeat_agents_list`
    into a `FleetSnapshot`. Status taxonomy extends view_fleet's (`running` / `down` / `orphan` /
    `DUPLICATE` / `zombie`) with **`stale-heartbeat`** — locally up but the node's `last_seen` is old (the
    "connector up, daemon not polling" case).
  - **`app.py` + `render.py`** — the Textual UI: a status bar, an agent table (color-coded status), and a
    detail pane with **Overview / Config / Logs tabs** (`o`/`c`/`l`). Overview shows the basics + the agent's
    README; Config shows the LLM profile + ordered provider→model chain + offer/workflow-compat counts; Logs
    tails the watchdog log. Two refresh tiers run off the UI thread: LOCAL (~2 s, no network) and NODE
    (~13 s, one cached `agents_list` call) — never a tight-loop AIMEAT call.
  - **`versions.py`** — installed vs latest for `aimeat-crewai` (PyPI) and the `aimeat` CLI (npm), with an
    update flag; fetched off-thread + cached.
  - **`agent_meta.py`** — per-agent enrichment, all LOCAL: the LLM routing chain (`llm_providers.json`), the
    offer/workflow-compatibility counts, and the crew's README (FIGLET banner reduced to plain text).
  - **`actions.py`** — fleet control behind confirm modals, off the UI thread: start/stop/restart a selected
    crew (`s`/`x`/`r`), start/stop/restart the whole fleet (`S`/`X`/`R`), re-auth (`a`), reap stray serve
    daemons (`d`). Every mutating action is safety-routed (stop kills watchdog-then-daemon by crew filename
    only — never the serve daemon; fleet stop uses `terminate_fleet.ps1`; reap uses `ensure_single_serve`).
  - Optional `[tui]` extra (`textual>=0.60`); the `crewaimeat-tui` entry point. Plan: `docs/internal/tui-plan.md`.
- **`forge.stop_crew` / `forge.recycle_crew`** — a real stop (kill the watchdog FIRST so it cannot respawn,
  then the daemon; matched by crew filename, so the serve daemon is never touched) and a true restart
  (stop → relaunch). Plain `start_crew` / `reauth` twins of the `@tool`-wrapped versions so code/the TUI can
  call them (a `@tool` object is not callable).
- **Single-serve invariant** (`src/crewaimeat/serve_guard.py`) — `ensure_single_serve()`: a cross-process
  lock around the check→spawn plus a dedup pass that reaps any serve daemon `serve.json` does not point at.
  Two daemons stole each other's tunnels (a reconnect storm) and dispatched tasks timed out silently — the
  "(L)AIMEAT Sanomat just didn't update, no error" failure. `scripts/ensure_serve.py` + the serve-watchdog
  now go through it.
- **postman durable mail dedup** (`mail_contract.process_mail`) — a per-machine sent-marker
  (`logs/.postman_mail_sent_runs.json`): a mail this machine already delivered is never re-sent, even when
  the workspace record's `done` write does not stick (a cross-agent settle / stale read). Fixes the
  "Market scan re-sent on every fleet start" bug.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-04 → 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Agent Workflows — chained scheduled pipelines with per-step health (crew-side reference + the live
  Sanomat migration).** A *workflow* is a declared, ordered set of steps with ONE schedule trigger and
  per-step two-sided **signals** — `required_to_function` (the consumer's input gate, checked before a step
  dispatches) and `success_signal` (the producer's output contract, checked after) — so the owner sees "did
  the step PRODUCE", not just "did it fire". `src/crewaimeat/workflow_spec.py` (the descriptor + a recursive
  signal evaluator: `exists`/`nonempty`/`count_nonempty`/`json_valid`/`json_field`, composites
  `all`/`any`/`when-then`, owner-scope memory reads, `check_workflow` test-run, `node_definition()` that emits
  the node `aimeat_workflow_save` payload), `workflow_inspector.py` + `crews/workflow_inspector_crew.py` (the
  three-tier diagnose/auto-repair/escalate handler), and `tests/test_workflow_spec.py`. The **(L)AIMEAT
  Sanomat 6→1 migration is live**: the six per-agent evening crons are replaced by one
  `laimeat-sanomat-evening` workflow (fetch → write-a/write-b → features/editorial, + space-weather), signals
  inherited from each stage agent's offer; reversible cutover (old schedules disabled, not deleted). First
  full run all-green 2026-06-13. The node owns the deterministic engine + signal evaluation; crewaimeat ships
  the descriptor/reference + the inspector. Node-engine spec + fix specs published to the AIMEAT Development
  workspace.
- **Agent Offers surface** (`src/crewaimeat/offers.py`) — each agent advertises what it does as machine-
  readable **offers**: derived deterministically from the workspace CONTRACTs (requirements / consequences /
  `deliverable.location` / repeatability / verification) plus authored constants for the task-runner crews,
  published via `PUT /v1/agents/:name/offers`. Offers also carry the workflow **signals** + `deliverableKey`
  (what makes an agent "workflow-compatible"), and the crews resolve **offer tasks** structurally (OFFER TASK
  SHAPE / `scope.offer_id`). Samples are a real excerpt of the agent's latest deliverable, never invented.
- **Connector forward tunnel** (aimeat 1.23.0 / aimeat-crewai 0.4.0) — `_aimeat_call` rides ONE shared
  loopback `aimeat connect serve --http` daemon (push task delivery, ~150 ms warm vs subprocess-seconds);
  64 connector processes → 2. `start_fleet.ps1` pre-starts the daemon once (`scripts/ensure_serve.py`).
- **Serve-daemon supervisor** (`src/crewaimeat/serve_watchdog.py` + `scripts/serve_watchdog.ps1`) — the shared
  tunnel daemon was an **unwatched single point of failure**; the supervisor calls the idempotent
  `ensure_serve` on a timer so a crashed daemon comes back in seconds and is never double-spawned. start_fleet
  launches it detached; terminate_fleet stops it first.
- **Native-crash isolation for web extraction** (`src/crewaimeat/_extract_worker.py`) — trafilatura → lxml →
  libxml2 can hard-kill the process with a Windows native fast-fail (exit `0xC0000409`,
  STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN, incl. at interpreter shutdown) on a malformed page — uncatchable from Python,
  and it took down the long-lived news-fetcher daemon. Extraction now runs in a **throwaway subprocess**
  (`article_extract._isolated_extract` → `python -m crewaimeat._extract_worker --url|--html`): a crash kills
  only the worker, the daemon survives and skips that one URL. stdout-first so a crash *after* the text was
  written still keeps it; UTF-8 in / ASCII-safe out.
- **`web-researcher` market + company research contracts** — `market-scan` (parameterized competitor/market
  analysis: who plays, where they advertise, how to sell against them; recurring, mailed) and
  `company-research` (Finnish company profiles: PRH/YTJ official XBRL financials first, then finder.fi charts
  via Playwright + vision), chained off the market scan.
- **`postman` + the 07:00 morning report** — an email-out workspace contract (SMTP, owner allowlist) that
  delivers a daily report (insights + action points + competitor watch), with a generic `extra-sections` hook
  other contracts append to, and the "Grok loop" (prompt in the mail, reply ingested back to the radar).
- **`image-scout`** — a moodboard contract: SearXNG image search → vision-curated gallery documents (subject/
  style/colors/relevance), uploaded via the presigned storage flow (binary never base64s through MCP).
- **Per-crew LLM routing (`llm_providers.json` profiles)** — `get_llm(agent_name=...)` now picks a named
  provider **profile** per crew: `{"profiles": {"content": {...}, "coding": {...}}, "default": "content",
  "crews": {"aimeat-app-builder": "coding", ...}}`. So content crews (news/editorial/features) route to
  **grok** and code/app crews (app-builder, conductor, cortex-fixer, realtime-builder, web-tester, crew-forge,
  …) route to a **non-grok coder** — grok is strong at prose, weak at code. The scaffold passes
  `spec.agent_name` when building each crew's `ctx.llm`; the deterministic content pipelines call `get_llm()`
  with no agent and so use `default`. The old flat `{"providers": [...]}` format still works (one chain for
  all). See `llm_providers.example.json`.
- **Deterministic content pipeline** — the CrewAI crews left deterministic steps to the LLM (whether to run
  trafilatura, which categories to write, copy-vs-rewrite the editorial) and grok skipped them → stub
  RSS-snippet raw, skipped/empty articles, a polite "Päätoimittaja" clobber of the gonzo editorial. Rewrote
  fetch/write/features/editorial as CODE orchestration (grok only writes prose):
  `fetch_pipeline` (curated feeds + SearXNG + ALWAYS trafilatura → rich raw),
  `write_pipeline` (code loop, a full article per category from the raw — no skips),
  `features_pipeline` (koodaus/prompt-niksi/matikka + parsed-and-validated quiz JSON),
  `editorial_pipeline` (gonzo S.J. editorial stored VERBATIM + deterministic `index_frontpage_auto` with
  per-article source counts — no publisher clobber). The news-fetcher / news-writer(+b) / editorial-writer /
  daily-features-writer crews are now thin wrappers that resolve the target date+edition and call one tool.
  Also: grok-4.3 primary via litellm-xai, curated RSS feed registry (`feed_sources.py`), per-article source
  counts + provenance badges in the newspaper, once-daily evening (18:00) schedule.
- **Automated test floor** (`tests/`, run with `uv run pytest`) — the first test suite in the repo.
  Deterministic, no LLM, no network: pure-function tests for the scaffold publish/verify path; a
  per-crew `build_domain` contract across all 27 crews (returns agents+tasks, in-crew agents, context
  chaining, **`ctx.prompt` is injected**, no delegation, `max_iter` is a sane backstop); the SYS-1
  completion-gate + auto-revert; and the reusable guardrails. See `tests/README.md`.
- **`crews/_guardrails.py`** — reusable, LLM-free task guardrails (fence-stripping JSON validation,
  required-field, 1–10 score, source-URL presence) for wiring onto prose-only task contracts.
- **`CrewSpec.require_verify_pass`** (default `False`) — **SYS-1**: for build/SDLC crews that run the app
  verify gates, gate task **completion** on the gates' deterministic `{ok}` outcome (not the agent's
  self-report). A build that failed a gate — or never ran one — is **failed** (`aimeat_task_fail`)
  instead of being marked `done` "green". Piloted on `aimeat-cortex-fixer` and `aimeat-realtime-builder`.
- **`CrewSpec.auto_revert_on_fail`** (default `False`) — SYS-1 live rollback: when set *with*
  `require_verify_pass`, a gate-fail also restores each app the run published to its pre-run last-good
  version (`author_tool.revert_apps_to_baseline`), re-publishing the prior version. Kept a **separate**
  opt-in from the (status-only) gate so the outward-facing live rollback is enabled deliberately, per
  crew. Off everywhere by default.
- **`AIMEAT_AGENT_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`** env (default off) — an optional per-agent wall-clock bound that
  stops a *stuck* run without truncating a long-but-progressing build (safer than lowering `max_iter`).
- **`OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS`** env (default off) — a comma-separated **model-fallback chain** passed to
  OpenRouter as its `models` array (via litellm `extra_body`). OpenRouter tries each id IN ORDER and skips
  one that errors — **including a provider `400`** (verified against a cloaked/"alpha" model whose upstream
  went down). Keeps the fleet running when the primary model dies, and auto-resumes the primary if it
  recovers. E.g. `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free,openai/gpt-oss-20b:free,openrouter/owl-alpha`.
- **Multi-provider LLM routing (`llm_providers.json`, OpenClaw-style)** — a provider + model **priority
  chain**: `get_llm` tries providers in order and each provider's models in order, falling through on ANY
  error **across providers** (e.g. OpenRouter free → local **Ollama** → xAI). Each model carries its
  **context window**, and the chain sizes prompts to the *smallest* window so a 32k local model is never
  over-filled behind a 128k one. Types: `openrouter`, `ollama` (local, keyless), `xai`, `openai`, `generic`;
  a provider whose key env is missing is skipped (not fatal). `MultiProviderLLM` is **composition** over
  CrewAI's `LLM` (a `BaseLLM` subclass — CrewAI's `LLM` is a factory that re-dispatches subclasses). The env
  path (`OPENROUTER_MODEL` + `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS`) still works when no config file is present.
  Gitignored; see `llm_providers.example.json`. Born from owl-alpha's outage: free models needed prioritising
  and a local fallback.
- **`scripts/check_models.py`** — a **model-capability check**: runs a battery (completion, JSON output, and a
  real SearXNG **search-crew**) against the models in `llm_providers.json` (or `--models a,b,c`) and prints a
  scorecard of which can actually drive crewaimeat. Surfaced the real fetch failure — weak models build
  garbage search queries (e.g. putting the date/edition in the query) and return nothing — so a model is
  vetted before the fleet trusts it. `--quick` skips the slow search test.
- **`revert_app` / `list_app_versions`** author tools + a per-run rollback **baseline** recorded by
  `publish_app`, so a crew (or the scaffold) can restore a prior working app version.
- **New crew `aimeat-app-designer`** — the SDLC "Web Designer": re-skins a functionally-ready app
  (Tailwind/DaisyUI + Motion One) in place, presentation-only, with `verify_interaction` as the
  regression gate.
- **Docs**: `docs/aimeat-guides/crewairesearch/` (researched CrewAI best-practices guides) and
  `docs/aimeat-guides/nextgeneration/` (an audit of this scaffold + 27 crews against those guides, with a
  prioritized roadmap and ready-to-run Claude Code eval prompts), plus an AIMEAT API request doc for the
  cortex/extension upsert (now delivered — see below).
- **`startup.prompt.md`** — a paste-into-Claude-Code/Copilot **runbook** that onboards a fresh clone
  end-to-end: it asks only what it can't know (which AIMEAT node — `aimeat.io` or self-hosted — the owner
  account, the model key), then installs, registers + approves the agents, starts the fleet, and teaches the
  essentials of working with AIMEAT. `README.md` now leads with it.
- **`fetch_article_text` author tool** (`src/crewaimeat/article_extract.py`) — full article-text extraction
  (**trafilatura** primary, Playwright-render fallback) with **top-N domain-diverse** URL selection, wired
  into `news-fetcher` so writers work from real article bodies, not 1-line search snippets.
- **Content pipeline greatly expanded** (the `(L)AIMEAT Sanomat` newspaper): **21 news sections, each with a
  named persona**, and **`news-writer` split into two parallel desks** (`news-writer` + new
  **`news-writer-b`**, ~12 agents each) so the write stage stays fast. New **`daily-features-writer`** crew
  (päivän koodausosio / prompt-niksinurkka / matematiikkahetki + an **interactive uutisvisa** generated from
  the day's news) and **`space-weather-writer`** (avaruussää article from NOAA/NASA). Newspaper widgets:
  Finland-oriented **moon phase**, **Sää tänään + huomenna** (Open-Meteo, CORS, incl. FMI HARMONIE), avaruussää
  images (NOAA SWPC + NASA SDO), **nimipäivät** from a shared public `almanac.namedays` key, per-article
  **🔊 Puhu** (Web-Speech TTS), the interactive quiz, and a **päivävalitsin** edition navigator that scales to
  many editions. Daily schedules run the whole thing twice a day autonomously (aamu/ilta).

### Changed
- **`install_cortex` / `install_extension`** now redeploy via the new idempotent **`PUT /v1/cortex/{name}`
  / `PUT /v1/extensions/{name}`** upsert (shipped on the AIMEAT node 2026-06-05) instead of
  `deactivate → DELETE → re-POST`. This removes the brief live outage and the cortex-quota churn on every
  redeploy. (An interim byte-compare "skip redeploy if unchanged" guard was added then retired once PUT
  landed — PUT is idempotent server-side.)
- **`ask_owner`** option parsing is robust: JSON array first (an option may contain commas), then
  `|`-delimited, then comma — fixing options like `"Text only (date, title, body)"` shattering into three.
- **`workflow._dispatch_one`** retries subtask creation 3× (with backoff) under connector load, instead of
  forging a redundant crew over a transient node blip.
- **Crew prompt hardening** to make build loops converge (the real fix for hit `max_iter` caps):
  `aimeat-app-builder` (exact-id selector discipline; reuse libs, prefer no cortex), `aimeat-cortex-fixer`
  (read extension-owned data from `ext:<ext>`; mandatory deploy **and** verify), `aimeat-realtime-builder`
  (the canonical realtime recipe: token → find-or-create room → presence from the `joined` event).

### Fixed
- **Durable per-machine run markers** (`src/crewaimeat/local_marks.py`) — a fleet restart could re-fire a
  contract scan that had already run (the market-scan "6 mails in one day" bug); markers now persist per
  machine so a restart can't re-trigger a completed scan.
- **Contract-agent runaway guard** — an idle-hook contract agent that deduped on a just-written status could
  re-process a request hundreds of times under read-after-write lag; added a per-run processed-set + per-run
  cap + output-existence dedup (never trust a status you just wrote back).
- **Offers**: deliverable samples are real multi-line Markdown (flattening made the leading `#` swallow the
  whole sample); offer tasks resolve structurally instead of drifting to a guessed target.
- **`daily-features-writer`** never fabricates the news quiz — it validates the quiz JSON and **skips** (loud)
  rather than writing a placeholder when too few articles are readable; **`editorial-writer`** has a
  self-healing guard for the evening edition. Both generalised by the workflow inspector.
- **Single-spawner discipline** — only `start_fleet` starts the shared serve daemon (crews attach, never
  spawn), preventing the multi-daemon "tunnel-stealing" storms; `start_fleet.ps1`'s fragile inline
  `python -c` step moved to `scripts/ensure_serve.py` (a quoting edge case raised a SyntaxError and aborted
  the start).
- **`news_writer`** — the three category-writer agents had **no `tools=`** yet their tasks instruct
  `write_memory(...)`, so articles never reached memory. Added `make_memory_tools` to all three.
- **`finnish_corporate_researcher`** — the synthesis report header was a non-f-string, so it printed the
  literal `{ctx.today}` / `{ctx.prompt}`. Now interpolated (clean date + the real query).
- **UTF-8 read fix** (`author_tool`) — all app/lib content reads (`read_app_source`, `revert_app`,
  `read_app_template`, `read_node_api`) force UTF-8; `requests`' Latin-1 default for `text/html` was
  corrupting Scandinavian text (`ä`→`Ã¤`) on every read-then-republish.
- **Newspaper view counter** — rewritten from one-key-per-view (which hit the `/v1/mm` **100-keys-per-set**
  cap and started 400-ing) to a **per-edition counter** (read → +1 → overwrite); historical views migrated,
  counts preserved.
- **`index_frontpage` dedups by concrete `(gaii, key)`** — the old logical-slot key drifted when `kind`
  varied between two editorial runs, so every article got a second front-page entry ("tuplauutiset"). The
  public viewer also dedups client-side as a belt-and-suspenders.

### Notes
- The **`max_iter` audit recommendation was reversed by field data**: `max_iter` is a justified backstop
  (it fires on non-convergent re-authoring loops, not runaways), so the test floor no longer pressures
  lowering it. The real runaway levers are prompt convergence, verify-gated completion + auto-revert, and
  the optional wall-clock bound. See `docs/aimeat-guides/nextgeneration/04-general-improvement-roadmap.md`.
- Still open on the AIMEAT side (they flagged it): `generator-registration.ts` loses cortex lib files on a
  *generator* re-deploy (cascade-delete then recreate without re-writing libs) — a separate path from the
  HTTP routes that were fixed.
